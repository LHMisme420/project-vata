**VATA Code Security Scanner**

- Detects malicious patterns (eval/exec, destructive commands, hardcoded secrets, etc.)
- Provides structured violation reports
- Estimates stylistic complexity score (higher = more variable, commented, idiosyncratic style; lower = unusually uniform/clean, often synthetic)

For research and pipeline integration use only. Not a production-grade detector yet.

No spiritual or personality framing is used.
