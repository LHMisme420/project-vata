# Contributing to Project VATA

Thank you for your interest in Project VATA! We aim to close the AI accountability gap with ZK-proofs and decentralized agents aligned to human values. Contributions should align with this vision—focus on ethics enforcement, ZK improvements, or humanizer enhancements. Off-topic (e.g., unrelated features) may be closed to maintain scope.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork and Clone**: Fork the repo, clone locally: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-vata.git`.
2. **Set Up Environment**: Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. (Add if needed.)
3. **Make Changes**: Branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`. Follow code style (e.g., PEP8 for Python).
4. **Test Locally**: Run tests: `pytest`. All PRs must pass tests—add new ones for your changes.
5. **Submit PR**: Push and open a PR against main. Describe changes, link issues, and confirm ethics alignment (e.g., "This enhances ZK verification without weakening safeguards").

## Expectations
- **Response Time**: We aim to review PRs within 7 days (maintainers volunteer ~5 hours/week).
- **Accepted Contributions**: Bug fixes, ZK circuit examples, language support (e.g., JS/TS for humanizer), docs. No major refactors without discussion.
- **Code of Conduct**: Be respectful—see CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (add if not present).
- **Ethics Check**: Changes impacting agents must not bypass the Sacred Ethics Charter.

For bugs/features, use issue templates (see .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE). Questions? Join our Discord: [link].
